A tool to help with running Pathfinder 2e Society Games, including Bounties, Quests, and Season scenarios. Multi-Import available to import multiple PDFs at a time, but requires signed PDFs with Paizo's header information intact to function.

If no PDFs have been extracted there will be no other buttons available. Seasons with no module implemented yet will be grayed out, as will any imported scenarios that have yet to be implemented.
